<h1>SLA Ticket Handling with Jira</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
My project consists of an overview of the process that takes place when a ticket is submitted in Jira, a ticketing system that is freely available. The process would include the steps from: creating the ticket, receiving the ticket, assigning it to the correct agent, doing a post-incident write up and finally adding the incident to a knowledge base. For this project, I created an imaginary organisation and a simulated ticket for a printer ghosting problem. The aim of the project is to resolve the ticket, then add it to the knowledge base. Once it's in the knowledge base, I will simulate a customer to search for the issue in the customer portal, and search for an issue, which I should then see in the search bar the article which has been posted on how to resolve this specific problem.

Creating a project in Jira:<br/>

<br />
<br />
Logged in and view project dashboard: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Adding an agent to the project dashboard: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Generating a ticket for a hardware problem: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Ticket is now visible in the dashboard in the TO-DO list: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Assigning the ticket to an agent (in this case agent007): <br/>

<br />
<br />
Adding a slack channel to the project, although it was not later used, I wanted to install the app as it would be benificial to install in a real project: <br/>

<br />
<br />
The resolution part was done by researching how to resolve printer ghosting. Once the resolution was done I created a post incident review: <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/CKR9GPK.png" height="60%" width="60%"
/>
<br />
<br />
Post-incident write up. I used the 5 whys when looking at the root cause, and used my existing knowledge from the CompTIA A+ as well as researching to come up with the root cause and resolution: <br/>

/>
<br />
<br />
Once the incident was resolved and post-incident write up was complete, I moved both of them to the 'Done' section:<br/>

/>
<br />
<br />
Now I will begin adding this incident to the knowledge base by accessing it on the dashboard:<br/>

/>
<br />
<br />
Ensuring the right access to the articles so that I can create and edit an article:<br/>

/>
<br />
<br />
Linking the post incident write up to the confluence content. This link is important for when doing the Article:<br/>

/>
<br />
<br />
Linking project to knowledge base:<br/>
<img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/npDq81717902491.png" height="60%" width="60%"
/>
<br />
<br />
Doing the article write up for the incident in question. I used the template that was suggested by Jira as a starting point and added on to it.:<br/>
<img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/iLRHq1717902703.png" height="60%" width="60%"
/>
<br />
<br />
Ensuring the article is in the right category, this is important for when searching through the knowledge base:<br/>
<img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/ddjEu1717902832.png" height="60%" width="60%"
/>
<br />
<br />
Logging in as a customer through the Jira customer log in. I essentially used the same URL as the project and added '/servicedesk/customer/portal/':<br/>
<img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/mAWva1717902955.png" height="60%" width="60%"
/>
<br />
<br />
In the search bar of customer portal, I typed in what a user may type when trying to resolve a printer problem:<br/>
<img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/BXJ5R1717903098.png" height="80%" width="80%"
/>
<br />
<br />
Through the search bar, the article for the printer ghosting resolution was available to view, meaning a user would be able to know how to potentially resolve the issue on their own through this article in the knowledge base:<br/>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
The project was able to: recieve a ticket, assign it to the correct agent, resolve the issue & complete a post incident write-up, and finally add this ticket into the knowledge base for future reference. If I was to improve on this project, I would look at adding multiple agents, as well as more tickets with varying priority, to see how ticket prioritisation may affect the queue for tickets. I would potentially look creating an automated ticket resolver, based on being able to access the knowledge base to match tickets to methods of resolution.
